# Coin Magnet Catch Game

## About
Coin Magnet Catch is a fun and simple game where you control a magnet to catch falling coins. The goal is to catch as many coins as you can before the time runs out (10 seconds). It has background music, sound effects, and smooth movement.

## How to Play
- **Objective**: Catch as many coins as you can in 10 seconds.
- **Controls**:
  - **Arrow keys**: Move the magnet around the screen.
  - **R key**: Restart the game.
  - **Q key**: Quit the game.
- The game ends when time’s up!

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The language used to code the game.
- **Pygame**: A library for making games, handling graphics and sounds.

## Sound and Images
- **COINN.wav**: Sound when you catch a coin.
- **triple_bubble_music_-_world_1_forest.wav**: Background music that plays during the game.
- **Coin.png**: Image of the coin.

## What I Learned
- I got better at using Pygame, especially with sprites, collision detection, and adding sounds.

## Challenges
- I had some trouble with making the coin respawn after being caught, but I figured it out.

## Improvements
- Next time, I want to add more features like power-ups or obstacles to make the game more fun.

## Changes From Plan
- I didn’t add some things I thought about, like power-ups or different levels, but the basic game works well.

## Keeping on Track
- I focused on getting the core game working first, then added extra features after that.
